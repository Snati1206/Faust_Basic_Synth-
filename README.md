# Faust_Basic_Synth-
## Faust Synth
This is a Synth created in Faust where I tried to add different features like the following:
  ## Detune
  I added a negative and a possitive number to the frequencies of 2 of the oscillators.
  ## AutoWah
  This effect has two parameters that can be controlled: the Dry/Wet of the Wah and an LFO who modules the intensity of the effect.
  ## Wavetype selector
  You have 3 oscillators that work independently and for each one of them you can select a different type of waveform (Sin, Triangle, Sawtooth)
  Each oscillator also has a different gain slider.
  ## LP filter
  Very basic LP filter. (The Q and Filter Gain Values still doesn't work as planned)
  ## Envelope for the amplitude values
  Here you have an ADSR envelope that controls the amplitude levels (at,dt,sl,rt)
  ## Harmonizer (4 octaves)
  Based in the 12 TET equation you can change the frequency of each oscillator within the range of 4 octave from -24 to +24 semi-tones (n1,n2,n3)
